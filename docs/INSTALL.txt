collective.seeder Installation
------------------------------

* Add ``collective.seeder`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.seeder
       
* Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:

    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.seeder
      
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.

If you want to automatically start seeding the created torrents, you can use a command line torrent client like rtorrent or deluged and configure it to watch your torrents folder for all changes.

You can specify the torrent trackers, object fields that you would like to seed and the torrents directory in Plone Control Panel-> Seeder Settings.

A symlink of the uploaded file and a torrent file will be stored in the torrents directory. 
As some torrent clients (e.g. deluged) delete the torrent files once they add it to their queue, you must also specify a "safe" torrent directory that the torrent files will get copied to as a failsafe. Both the torrents and the "safe" torrents direcotiries must by ABSOLUTE paths with write access from the zope effective user.
